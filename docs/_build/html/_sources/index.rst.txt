BioSimulators-GillesPy2 documentation

BioSimulators-GillesPy2 provides a

BioSimulators

-compliant command-line interface to the

GillesPy2

 biological simulation tool. A Docker image for this package is also
available.

This command-line interface and Docker image enable users to use
GillesPy2 to execute

COMBINE/OMEX archives

 that describe one or more simulation experiments (in

SED-ML format

) of one or more models (in

SBML format

).

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by
GillesPy2 is available at

BioSimulators

.

A simple web application and web service for using GillesPy2 to
execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at

runBioSimulations

.
